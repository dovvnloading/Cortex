## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send a detailed report to:

**[Devaux.mail@gmail.com](mailto:Devaux.mail@gmail.com)**

To help us triage and resolve the issue quickly, please include the following in your report:
- A clear and descriptive summary of the vulnerability.
- The steps required to reproduce the issue (including any proof-of-concept code).
- The potential impact of the vulnerability (e.g., remote code execution, data disclosure, denial of service).
- Any suggested mitigations, if available.

## Our Commitment

After you have submitted a report, we will make a best effort to:
- Acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours.
- Provide you with an initial assessment of the report's validity and severity.
- Keep you informed of our progress as we investigate and resolve the issue.
- Coordinate with you on the public disclosure of the vulnerability after a patch is available.

We value the work of security researchers and appreciate your help in keeping our project and its users safe.
