### **Version Update: Enhanced Conversational Logic**

This update addresses a critical bug in the conversation history processing that could cause the AI to misinterpret the flow of dialogue, leading to unnatural or repetitive responses.

**Key Improvements:**

*   **Resolved Repetition Bug:** We have fixed a core logical issue where the AI would sometimes perceive the user's most recent message as a repeated statement. This completely resolves conversational artifacts (e.g., the AI greeting you "again" on the first message) and significantly improves the model's contextual understanding.
*   **Improved Response Quality:** By ensuring the AI receives a clean and accurate conversational context, its responses will now be more logical, relevant, and coherent, starting from the very first turn of any new chat.

Users should experience a noticeable improvement in the quality and natural flow of their interactions.

### **Version Update: Ux Enhancement - Chat History Management**

This update is focused on providing you with greater control over your conversational data by introducing a powerful new privacy feature.

**New Feature: Clear All Chat History**

You now have the ability to permanently delete your entire chat history from the application. This action performs a "clean sweep" of all recorded conversations, resetting your history to a blank slate.

This new option is accessible by **right-clicking the "+ New Chat" button** in the history panel.

To prevent accidental data loss, a confirmation prompt will appear, clearly warning that this action is irreversible. This feature is designed to give you ultimate control over your personal data within the application.
