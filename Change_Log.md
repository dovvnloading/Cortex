The Keystone Update

### **Version Update: Enhanced Conversational Logic**

This update addresses a critical bug in the conversation history processing that could cause the AI to misinterpret the flow of dialogue, leading to unnatural or repetitive responses.

**Key Improvements:**

*   **Resolved Repetition Bug:** We have fixed a core logical issue where the AI would sometimes perceive the user's most recent message as a repeated statement. This completely resolves conversational artifacts (e.g., the AI greeting you "again" on the first message) and significantly improves the model's contextual understanding.
*   **Improved Response Quality:** By ensuring the AI receives a clean and accurate conversational context, its responses will now be more logical, relevant, and coherent, starting from the very first turn of any new chat.

Users should experience a noticeable improvement in the quality and natural flow of their interactions.
